</p>
<p>Women are widely underrepresented in the tech industry. Even after a lot of
women focussed hiring drives by big companies such as Adobe, Flipkart,
Amazon, etc. The gender ratio is nowhere near 50%. 

A lack of representation for women in tech can hinder a woman’s ability to succeed in the industry. It can put limits on their opportunities for mentorship and sponsorship and can lend to fostering “unconscious gender bias in company culture,” leaving many women “without a clear path forward,” according to a report from TrustRadius.
